# 13th_Challenge


## Summary of Purpose  

This is not a program/app.  

In this challenge, I made three different neural networks that predict whether or not a startup will succeed or fail (I'm not sure whether or not the data I used was real, but it gave me 10 pieces of criteria regarding ~30,000 startups).

The neural networks have been exported to the resources folder.

## Required/Compatible Technologies

**Compatible OS's:** Mac, Windows, or Linux  
**Programming language:** Python inside of a Jupyter Notebook (filetype: .ipynb)
**Required libraries/installations:**  

    *import pandas as pd
    *from pathlib import Path
    *import tensorflow as tf
    *from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
    *from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    *from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    *from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder
     
Using a conda environment from anaconda is preferable.

## How to Open the Code

You can view it on this github repository.

Alternatively, you can use Jupyter Lab or some program that can run .ipynb files (e.g. VS Code using some extensions/add-ons).

The cells should have already been run. If some haven't been run, then restart the kernel and run all the cells.
